# Chemistry Lab 3D

[![Deploy docs to GitHub Pages](https://github.com/psy-zney/chemistryLAB/actions/workflows/deploy-docs-pages.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/psy-zney/chemistryLAB/actions/workflows/deploy-docs-pages.yml)

Chemistry Lab 3D is a native Unity/C# desktop game. It is not a web build. The repository root is the canonical Unity project; its production desktop module lives in `Assets/ChemistryLab`. It is a Windows-focused first-person chemistry laboratory where the player walks around a 3D room, picks chemicals, loads vessels, observes reactions, and sees safety consequences when hazardous gases are handled incorrectly.

The game is built as an educational simulation, not as real laboratory operating guidance.

## Current Feature Set

- Native Unity 6 desktop project using C#.
- First-person 3D laboratory with chemist hands, WASD movement, mouse look, sprint FOV, camera bob, interactable shelves, fume hood, workbench, sink, analysis bench, periodic table, and safety equipment.
- 52 high-school-relevant periodic elements with physical and chemical descriptions.
- 40 catalogued chemicals with phase, model type, color, molar mass, density, melting point, boiling point, appearance, solubility, hazards, handling notes, and common use.
- 38 curated reactions with equations, stoichiometry, product colors, yield estimates, observations, disposal notes, effects, and fume hood requirements.
- Data-driven compound-generation matrix with 27 high-school element nodes, 46 common ions, 565 accepted coordinates representing 541 unique formulas, 45 reviewed property overrides, and explicit rejection rules for unstable combinations.
- Dynamic reaction engine that keeps curated reactions authoritative, then derives additional valid reactions from ion/species rules and asks the compound matrix for charge-balanced formulas, solubility, color, hazards, and confidence.
- 9 dynamic reaction rule families covering acid/base, carbonate, bicarbonate, sulfide, ammonium/base, precipitation, metal displacement, metal/acid, and basic oxide/acid reactions.
- Reaction-condition engine with independent vessel temperature and volume, molar concentration, acid/base-equivalent pH, catalyst requirements, rate classes, completion-time estimates, condition-dependent yield, and explicit blocked outcomes.
- 8 oxidation-reduction rules validated by electron least-common-multiple balancing, including acidic permanganate chemistry and concentration-dependent `Cu + HNO3` products.
- Persistent synthesized-product inventory. Every collected batch records mass, purity, phase, color, hazards, and source equation in JSON; reused material is mass-accounted and generated ionic products re-enter the dynamic reaction engine.
- Safety system for toxic, corrosive, flammable, oxidising, and asphyxiant gas outcomes. Unsafe reactions are allowed to happen, but the player pays health and credit consequences if they do not use the fume hood, respirator, or gas trap correctly.
- Runtime HUD with chemical inspector, vessel inspector, mission state, temperature, safety state, main menu, ESC pause menu, diagnostics, and persistent language, audio, reduced-motion, and window-mode settings.
- Vessel visuals blend solution colour and opacity with concentration, show gas bubbles rising to the surface, let precipitate settle into a bottom layer, and add restrained thermal or hazardous fumes. Reduced motion lowers emissions and removes colour easing.
- Physical sample staging: a held chemical must be placed on the preparation
  tray beside a vessel before it can be loaded; the staged bottle remains
  visible and remote loading is rejected.
- Reaction close view with a balanced-equation card, live condition/catalyst
  summary, observation text, skip controls, and reduced-motion fallback.
- First-run onboarding with a visible help button and a four-bottle starter tray containing water, copper sulfate, sodium hydroxide, and hydrochloric acid.
- Reviewed real-scale glassware assets: a 0.18 m Erlenmeyer reaction flask and 0.15 m test tubes, baked to lightweight native Unity meshes with simple physics colliders and recorded third-party provenance.
- Four original procedural reference props: hotplate/stirrer, PPE suit display, reagent-bottle rack, and fume-hood gas-wash train. No unverified downloaded geometry is shipped.
- Original Blender environment kit: detailed workbench/hood, shelves, recessed sink,
  framed architecture, preparation trays, shared reagent bottles and bench tools,
  integrated beneath runtime gameplay anchors. Matte resin/paint, steel and teal
  materials use 1K textures; readable glass uses bounded reflection and edge opacity.
- Procedural background audio, UI sounds, footsteps, pour/wash sounds, reaction sounds, and hazard alarm.
- JSON build, validation, and smoke-test reports under `BuildReports/`.

## Chemistry Matrix — Anion × Cation

Open the [2D explorer](https://zney295.id.vn/chemistryLAB/docs/chemistry/compound-matrix-2d.html)
for **21 anion rows × 25 cation columns**. Cells show stable ion IDs, charges,
reduced ratios, scoped evidence, descriptive conditions and exclusions.
The generated JSON comes from the canonical Unity resource;
`MatrixParityExport` compares actual C# results with the Pages exporter.
A neutral formula does not establish stability or authorize a reaction.

See the [2D data contract](docs/chemistry/compound-generation-matrix.md).
Four cells have narrowly scoped literature evidence; other nonexcluded cells
are formal compositions. Legacy property overrides are identified separately.
The catalogue has not been comprehensively scientifically certified.

The bounded game loop commits one reaction per vessel, applies consequences
once, allows one collection, then requires cleanup. Recorded inputs remain
visible after collection. Input-minus-collected mass is bookkeeping; solvent
and byproduct composition are not a complete mass-balance model.

## Optional 3D Projection

[![Actual Three.js view of the current chemistry compound matrix](docs/chemistry/compound-matrix-3d-preview.png)](https://psy-zney.github.io/chemistryLAB/docs/chemistry/compound-matrix-3d.html)

This legacy Three.js projection rebuilds
the same charge-balanced space as the Unity `CompoundGenerationMatrix`: **565
accepted coordinates, 541 unique formulas, 45 reviewed records, and 9 explicit
exclusions**. Its reviewed/rule-derived labels describe legacy property rules,
not complete evidence of stability or synthesis. Drag to orbit, use the mouse wheel to zoom, click a node to inspect
its physical properties and hazards, or press `Ctrl K` to find a formula such as
`CuSO4`.

For GitHub readers, open the live interactive viewer:

`https://psy-zney.github.io/chemistryLAB/docs/chemistry/compound-matrix-3d.html`

Repository maintainers must enable Pages once in GitHub:
`Settings -> Pages -> Build and deployment -> Source -> GitHub Actions`.
After that, the `Deploy docs to GitHub Pages` workflow publishes the viewer on
each relevant push to `main`.

When working from a local clone, open
[`docs/chemistry/compound-matrix-3d.html`](docs/chemistry/compound-matrix-3d.html)
through a static server:

```powershell
python -m http.server 4173
```

Then visit
`http://127.0.0.1:4173/docs/chemistry/compound-matrix-3d.html`.

The explorer projects the current enriched chemistry space into three axes:

| Axis | Runtime meaning | Examples shown |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **X — metal/cation** | Metal activity from strong to weak plus explicit oxidation state | K/Na, Mg/Ca, Al, Zn/Cr/Mn, Fe/Co/Ni, Pb/H, Cu/Ag |
| **Y — nonmetal/anion** | Nonmetal or reusable anion family | halide, sulfide, carbonate, nitrate, sulfate, phosphate, permanganate |
| **Z — oxygen/oxidation** | Oxygen count and oxidation-state layer | binary salts at `O = 0`; oxides, hydroxides, oxyacids and oxysalts at `O = 1…4+` |

A coordinate is not just a cell in a literal array. It carries ion charge,
oxidation state, formula coefficients, molar mass, phase, solubility, color,
hazards, confidence, and validation notes. Node color comes from the chemistry
JSON, node geometry identifies the compound family, and reviewed nodes are
larger than rule-derived nodes. Family, confidence, hazard-only, grid, and
rejected-coordinate filters can be combined without changing the source data.

This is a chemical relationship map, not a molecular-geometry or orbital model.
Three.js is used only for this interactive documentation view; the production
game remains the native Unity/C# desktop project.

Open the repository root in Unity and use `Assets/ChemistryLab`. The
documentation index is [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md). Coding agents should
start with [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md), which records the persistent product
contracts, repository map, skill routing, and validation rules for new sessions.

## Architecture Notes

The runtime uses regular Unity `MonoBehaviour` components at the scene edge, while chemistry data and algorithms are kept in plain C# classes where possible.

- `DesktopLabGame` is the composition root. It validates data, creates the HUD, builds the procedural 3D room, owns selected chemical state, owns vessel state, and calls audio/VFX/safety systems.
- `LabInteractable` is an abstract base class for world objects. `ChemicalBottleInteractable`, `SamplePreparationInteractable`, `VesselInteractable`, `SinkInteractable`, `AnalysisInteractable`, and `ElementTileInteractable` override the prompt and interaction behavior.
- `ReactionSimulator` evaluates vessel contents. It checks curated reactions, redox rules, then dynamic ionic rules; `ReactionConditionEngine` decides whether the matched reaction can run and scales its kinetics/yield.
- `ReactionEnvironment` owns temperature and volume for each physical vessel, so heating and dilution persist independently of the ingredient list.
- `RedoxReactionEngine` selects reviewed redox branches and verifies the shared electron count with a greatest-common-divisor/least-common-multiple algorithm.
- `SynthesizedInventory` and `RuntimeChemicalRegistry` turn an outcome into a mass-accounted reusable batch, persist it as JSON, and register matrix-backed products as new dynamic species.
- `CompoundGenerationMatrix` and `CompoundMatrix2D` expose anion rows and cation columns with ratios, evidence scope and exclusions. Element/oxidation-state oxides remain a separate registry; the optional 3D view projects legacy composition/property data.
- `DynamicReactionEngine` models species, reaction families, activity series, and bounded stoichiometry balancing. It consumes compound-matrix results instead of maintaining a second formula/solubility truth source.
- `LabSafetySystem` converts hazardous reaction outcomes into player consequences: health loss, credit loss, incident history, and emergency evacuation.
- `DesktopLabHud` renders the in-game information layer and owns the main, pause, and settings menu states. Settings can return to the menu that opened them; language, audio, reduced-motion, and display preferences persist through `PlayerPrefs`.
- `ModelAssetAudit` measures imported geometry, scale, materials, embedded scene objects, and collider state, then writes a JSON report. `ApprovedModelIntegration` normalizes reviewed native meshes, assigns the lightweight glass material, adds simple colliders, and regenerates runtime prefabs before a scene or Windows build is created.

or Back to Main Menu. Settings provides Vietnamese/English, audio,
reduced-motion, and fullscreen/windowed controls and saves them for the next
launch.

## Windows Portable Build

Run `Chemistry Lab -> Desktop -> Build Windows x64` in Unity. The pipeline
cleans the generated build root, produces the game, removes Burst
`DoNotShip` debug data, validates required Unity runtime files, writes a
manifest and README, then creates a versioned ZIP and SHA-256 checksum:

```text
Builds/ChemistryLab3D/
|-- Windows-x64/
|   |-- ChemistryLab3D.exe
|   |-- ChemistryLab3D_Data/
|   |-- MonoBleedingEdge/
|   |-- UnityPlayer.dll
|   |-- build-manifest.json
|   `-- README.txt
`-- Packages/
    |-- ChemistryLab3D-Windows-x64-v1.0.zip
    `-- ChemistryLab3D-Windows-x64-v1.0.zip.sha256
```

Run the local build from
`Builds/ChemistryLab3D/Windows-x64/ChemistryLab3D.exe`. Distribute the ZIP,
not the EXE by itself. Unity requires `ChemistryLab3D_Data`, `UnityPlayer.dll`,
and the managed runtime to remain beside the executable. The ZIP contains one
top-level `ChemistryLab3D-Windows-x64` folder so extraction stays tidy.

Use `Chemistry Lab -> Desktop -> Validate Windows Package` to recheck an
existing distribution without rebuilding it. See
[`docs/release/windows-portable-layout.md`](docs/release/windows-portable-layout.md)
for the packaging contract and release checks.

## Android Development APK

The canonical Unity project also contains the shared touch-control layer used
by Android: a pointer-owned movement pad, a separate look zone, touch action
buttons, and safe-area handling. Physical-device behavior still requires
real-device verification.

Install Unity `6000.5.3f1` with **Android Build Support**, **Android SDK & NDK
Tools**, and **OpenJDK**. Then open the repository root and run:

`Chemistry Lab -> Android -> Build Development APK`

The editor script switches to Android, keeps the game landscape-only, selects
IL2CPP + ARM64, uses API 26 as the minimum Android version, and builds a
development APK with Unity's debug signing configuration:

```text
Builds/Android/ChemistryLab3D-Android-dev.apk
```

The APK build does not require a release keystore. For store distribution, use
a separate release signing configuration and validate the project on physical
devices first.
